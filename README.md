Feed Pull
==============

This is a simple WordPress plugin that is largely based off of Automattic's Syndication plugin. Easily setup feeds to
be syndicated into WordPress. You can map feed attributes to post fields or post meta. Syndicated content can be mapped
to any post type you want. The plugin comes with a convenient settings page so you can configure things like when feeds
are syndicated.
